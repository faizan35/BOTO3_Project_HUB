# Project 1

To break down the **"Automated S3 Data Backup System"** project into smaller, manageable projects for learning, let's divide it into incremental steps:

### [Project 1.1](./1.1-Creating-S3-Bucket.md): Introduction to S3 and Creating a Bucket

**Description**: Learn the basics of Amazon S3, create an S3 bucket, and understand bucket properties.

**Tasks**:

1. Understand what Amazon S3 is and its use cases.
2. Set up an S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console.
3. Learn about bucket properties such as region, access control, and versioning.

### [Project 1.2](./1.2-Introduction-Boto3-S3.py): Introduction to Boto3 and S3

**Description**: Learn the basics of Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, and how to interact with S3 using Boto3.

**Tasks**:

1. Install Boto3 and set up AWS credentials.
2. Write a basic script to create an S3 bucket using Boto3.
3. List all S3 buckets in your AWS account using Boto3.

### Project 1.3: Uploading Files to S3

**Description**: Learn how to upload files from your local machine to an S3 bucket using Boto3.

**Tasks**:

1. Write a script to upload a single file to an S3 bucket.
2. Modify the script to upload multiple files from a directory.
3. Add error handling for common issues like missing files or incorrect permissions.

### Project 1.4: Implementing Versioning and Lifecycle Policies

**Description**: Understand and implement versioning and lifecycle policies in S3.

**Tasks**:

1. Enable versioning on your S3 bucket.
2. Write a script to upload a file with versioning enabled.
3. Set up lifecycle policies to transition objects to different storage classes or delete them after a certain period.

### Project 1.5: Scheduling Scripts with Cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)

**Description**: Learn how to schedule your backup script to run periodically.

**Tasks**:

1. Write a basic cron job to schedule a script in Linux.
2. Use Task Scheduler to schedule a script in Windows.
3. Schedule the S3 upload script to run daily.

### Project 1.6: Implementing Logging and Error Handling

**Description**: Enhance your script with logging and robust error handling.

**Tasks**:

1. Add logging to your S3 upload script to record successful and failed uploads.
2. Implement error handling for network issues, AWS service errors, and other potential problems.
3. Test your script with different error scenarios to ensure reliability.

### Combining Projects

**Description**: Combine all the smaller projects into the final "Automated S3 Data Backup System" project.

**Tasks**:

1. Integrate the versioning and lifecycle policy code into the upload script.
2. Ensure the script runs periodically using your chosen scheduling method.
3. Test the entire system to ensure it backs up data correctly, handles errors, and logs activity properly.

By working through these smaller projects, you'll build a strong foundation in using S3 and Boto3, scheduling tasks, and handling errors and logging, enabling you to successfully complete the larger automated backup system project.
