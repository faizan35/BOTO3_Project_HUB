# BOTO3_Project_HUB

10 real-world Boto3 projects that are commonly practiced in the industry, covering a range of AWS services and use cases:

### [Project 1](./01-Project/Readme.md): Automated S3 Data Backup System

**Description**: Create a script to automatically back up data from an on-premises location to an S3 bucket. Implement versioning and lifecycle policies to manage backups.

**Tasks**:

1. Set up an S3 bucket with versioning and lifecycle policies.
2. Write a script to upload files to S3.
3. Schedule the script to run periodically using cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
4. Implement error handling and logging.

### [Project 2](./02-Project/Readme.md): EC2 Instance Management Tool

**Description**: Develop a tool to manage EC2 instances, including starting, stopping, and monitoring instance status.

**Tasks**:

1. Write a script to start and stop EC2 instances.
2. Implement functionality to list running instances and their statuses.
3. Add logging and error handling.
4. Create a simple CLI or web interface for user interaction.

### Project 3: Serverless Image Processing Pipeline

**Description**: Build a serverless image processing pipeline using S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB. When an image is uploaded to S3, trigger a Lambda function to process the image and store metadata in DynamoDB.

**Tasks**:

1. Create an S3 bucket for image uploads.
2. Write a Lambda function to process images.
3. Set up an S3 event to trigger the Lambda function.
4. Store processed image metadata in DynamoDB.
5. Implement monitoring and logging.

### Project 4: Real-Time Log Analysis

**Description**: Set up real-time log analysis using CloudWatch Logs and Lambda. Use Boto3 to manage log streams and trigger alerts based on specific patterns.

**Tasks**:

1. Configure CloudWatch Logs to collect application logs.
2. Write a Lambda function to analyze log data.
3. Use Boto3 to create CloudWatch alarms based on log patterns.
4. Set up notifications using SNS.

### Project 5: Automated IAM Role Management

**Description**: Create a script to automate the creation and management of IAM roles and policies, ensuring compliance with organizational security standards.

**Tasks**:

1. Write a script to create IAM roles with specific policies.
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
3. Automate the rotation of IAM access keys.
4. Monitor and audit IAM role usage.

### Project 6: Data Ingestion Pipeline with Kinesis

**Description**: Develop a data ingestion pipeline using Kinesis Streams and Firehose to ingest, process, and store streaming data in S3.

**Tasks**:

1. Set up Kinesis Streams to capture streaming data.
2. Use Kinesis Firehose to deliver data to S3.
3. Write a Lambda function to process streaming data.
4. Monitor the pipeline using CloudWatch.

### Project 7: Cost Optimization Tool

**Description**: Create a cost optimization tool that uses Boto3 to analyze AWS resource usage and recommend cost-saving measures.

**Tasks**:

1. Use Boto3 to retrieve usage and cost data from AWS Cost Explorer.
2. Analyze data to identify underutilized resources.
3. Provide recommendations for cost optimization.
4. Generate and send reports via email using SES.

### Project 8: Disaster Recovery Implementation

**Description**: Implement a disaster recovery solution using Boto3 to replicate critical resources across AWS regions.

**Tasks**:

1. Set up cross-region replication for S3 buckets.
2. Automate the creation of AMIs and snapshot backups for EC2 instances.
3. Use Route 53 to manage DNS failover.
4. Implement a recovery plan and test it periodically.

### Project 9: Automated Security Audits

**Description**: Develop a tool to perform automated security audits using AWS Config and Boto3 to ensure compliance with security best practices.

**Tasks**:

1. Use AWS Config to capture configuration changes.
2. Write a script to evaluate compliance against security rules.
3. Generate audit reports and send notifications for non-compliance.
4. Implement remediation actions using Lambda functions.

### Project 10: Serverless REST API with API Gateway and Lambda

**Description**: Create a serverless REST API using API Gateway and Lambda, with Boto3 to interact with other AWS services like DynamoDB.

**Tasks**:

1. Set up API Gateway to handle HTTP requests.
2. Write Lambda functions for API endpoints.
3. Use DynamoDB for data storage.
4. Implement authentication and authorization using Cognito.

These projects will give you practical experience with Boto3 and demonstrate how it can be used to automate and manage various AWS services in real-world scenarios.
